Digital Clock:

A Digital Clock is a dynamic web application that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Built using HTML, it provides the basic structure for displaying the clock. CSS is used to style the clock for a visually appealing design. JavaScript powers the functionality, updating the time in real-time by fetching the current time from the user's system and refreshing the display every second. Itâ€™s an excellent beginner-friendly project to learn DOM manipulation and time functions.
